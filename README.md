# coronavirusProgram

cvp is a web scraping project that i made using vanilla javascript primarily as a way to learn. I used the puppeteer module with the nodejs environment to webscrape
the latest covid 19 statistics with regards to deaths and cases both worldwide and in the UK from the internet. I then compiled the javascript file 
into an executable for linux using a useful package i found on npm called pkg. For the executable to work you need to have chromium installed on your linux machine
and placed within the /usr/bin directory. I have also put the javascript file so that you can make the required customisation to create similar executables for other operating systems of your choice using the pkg npm package.
